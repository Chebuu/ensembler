Protein models are generated by mapping a set of target sequences onto a set of
template structures, with a series of successive refinement and filtering
stages to optimize model quality. This:

 - Exploits the entire variety of available genomic and structural data to provide diverse arrays of high-quality configurational models
 - Scales to allow the study of entire (super)families
 - Automates much of the time-consuming process of setting up protein systems for molecular simulation

The resulting models can be used as starting configurations for highly parallel
molecular simulations, which take advantage of modern high-performance
computing architectures. This approach is of particular benefit when used in
conjunction with recent techniques which can combine data from multiple
independent trajectories to produce kinetic models, such as Markov state
models.

Ensembler can be used via the command-line application (``ensembler``) or
scripted via the API, and can be run on a single computer or on a parallel
compute cluster. It makes use of a number of external packages:

 - `Modeller <https://salilab.org/modeller>`_ for comparative modeling of target sequences onto template structures
 - `Rosetta <https://www.rosettacommons.org/software>`_ loopmodel for reconstruction of missing template loops
 - `OpenMM <https://simtk.org/home/openmm>`_ for model refinement with highly efficient, GPU-acclerated, molecular dynamics simulation
 - `MDTraj <http://mdtraj.org>`_ for fast RMSD calculation


Overview of the Ensembler Pipeline
----------------------------------

The modeling and refinement process comprises a series of successive stages:

1. Retrieval of protein target sequences and template structures, e.g. from `UniProt <http://www.uniprot.org/>`_ and the `PDB <http://www.pdb.org>`_
2. (*optional*) Reconstruction of missing template loops, using ``Rosetta loopmodel``
3. Model generation - each target sequence is mapped onto each available template structure, using ``Modeller``
4. Culling of models based on close structural similarity
5. Refinement with implicit solvent molecular dynamics simulation, using ``OpenMM``
6. (*optional*) Solvation of models with explicit water
7. (*optional*) Refinement with explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulation, using ``OpenMM``
8. (*optional*) Packaging of models, ready for transfer or set-up on production simulation platforms such as ``Folding@Home``
